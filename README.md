## What is Genius Bot and what can it be used for?

Genius Bot is an open source discord bot. The bot client is written in Java 
and the dashboard is coded in PHP and HTML. It doesn't have the fanciest 
dashboard, but it gets the job done!

Quick note: From now on, I will be referring to servers as guilds. Servers and 
guilds mean the same thing, but guilds is the term developers use.

Genius Bot currently has three functions:

1. Genius bot can play music in voice channels.
2. Genius bot has a counter feature, which enables users to count in a text 
   channel in a guild.
3. Genius bot disallows users from being rude in guilds. No more toxicity in 
   guilds!
